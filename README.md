In this repository I've compiled some of the data analysis projects I've completed using R. These include projects completed for my classes on Economic Forecasting and Applied Machine Learning, as well as the code I used to complete an independent research project on auction fraud, "Identifying Auction Fraud with Decision Tree-Based Methods," which I also included as a PDF. I have uploaded some miscellaneous files on topics such as Monte Carlo integration and Kalman filters as well.

Each of the Econ 187 projects include many different machine learning methods, such as linear regression, regularization methods including LASSO and Ridge regression, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and classification and regression via gradient boosting and random forests.

The Econ 144 projects involve time series analysis methods, including ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and seasonal decomposition.
