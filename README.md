Hello! My name is Theo Teske and I'm currently a senior at UCLA.

In this repository I've compiled some of the data analysis projects I've completed using R. These include projects completed for my classes on Economic Forecasting and Applied Machine Learning, as well as the code I used to complete an independent research project on auction fraud, "Identifying Auction Fraud with Decision Tree-Based Methods," which I also included as a PDF. I have uploaded some miscellaneous files on topics such as Monte Carlo integration and Kalman filters as well.
